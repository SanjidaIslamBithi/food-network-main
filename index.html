            <p>Diet food (or dietetic food) refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat,
                carbohydrates, and/or sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet.</p>

                <h2>Salad</h2>
                <p>As soon as the temperature starts to dip in the fall, I look forward to making this salad. Made with
                    just 7 ingredients, itâ€™s a breeze to put together, but a bright lemon dressing, Parmesan cheese,
                    pine nuts, and dried cranberries make it zippy, fresh, and satisfying.</p>

                <h2>khir</h2>
                <p>Kheer is Indian rice pudding made with only three basic ingredients- rice, milk and sugar.
                    My recipe calls for more than 3 ingredients but those are all optional and add ons. A simple rice
                    kheer that my mom made was always made with only rice, sugar and milk.</p>

                <h2>French Toast</h2>
                <p>There are many, fancy variations on this basic recipe. This recipe works with many types of bread -
                    white, whole wheat, cinnamon-raisin, Italian or French. Serve hot with butter or margarine and maple
                    syrup.</p>
